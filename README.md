Chrome Extension built during Codesmith Hackathon

We are going to build an extension that puts up a privacy screen when pressed (opaque black background). 
It will then generate a button for you to press that will redirect you to a website (Codesmith).

Stretch Features: the privacy screen will imitate a real website (i.e: Google, Instagram, Github).
                  the extension will get the information of the current url and store it and place it as the redirect button

Technical Challenges: button will not disappear under overlay div even when z index is set to 1000 on overlay
